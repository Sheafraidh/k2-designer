# User Settings Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Major Change: Project Settings → User Settings**

Settings are now **user-specific** rather than **project-specific**. This is a significant architectural change that makes much more sense for preferences like theme, author name, and directory paths.

---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### Before (Project-Specific)
- Settings saved **in each project** (.k2p files)
- Settings exported/imported **with projects** (JSON)
- Each project could have different author/theme/paths
- Settings lost when sharing projects

### After (User-Specific)
- Settings saved **per-user** in home directory
- Settings stored in `~/.k2designer/settings.json`
- Same settings apply to **all projects**
- Settings persist across projects and sessions

---

## 📁 **Settings Location**

### File Path
```
~/.k2designer/settings.json
```

**On Different Systems:**
- **macOS/Linux**: `/home/username/.k2designer/settings.json`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\username\.k2designer\settings.json`

### File Format
```json
{
  "author": "John Doe",
  "template_directory": "/path/to/templates",
  "output_directory": "/path/to/output",
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

---

## 🆕 **New Components**

### 1. UserSettingsManager (`user_settings.py`)

New controller class for managing user settings:

```python
from k2_designer.controllers.user_settings import UserSettingsManager

# Create manager (automatically loads settings)
manager = UserSettingsManager()

# Get values
author = manager.author
theme = manager.theme

# Set values (auto-saves)
manager.author = "John Doe"
manager.theme = "dark"

# Update multiple
manager.update_settings({
    'author': 'Jane Smith',
    'theme': 'light'
})

# Get all
all_settings = manager.get_all_settings()
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-creates settings directory
- ✅ Auto-loads on initialization
- ✅ Auto-saves on changes
- ✅ Property-based access
- ✅ Batch updates
- ✅ Default values

**Lines:** ~130 lines

---

## 🔧 **Modified Components**

### 1. MainWindow (`main_window.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added `UserSettingsManager` instance
- Removed project-based theme application
- Apply user theme on startup
- Settings dialog uses user settings
- Menu item: "Project Settings" → "User Settings"

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Added in __init__:
self.user_settings = UserSettingsManager()
self._apply_user_theme()  # Apply on startup

# Removed:
self._apply_project_theme()  # No longer needed

# Updated:
def _apply_user_theme(self):
    theme = self.user_settings.theme  # From user settings
    # Apply theme...
```

### 2. ProjectSettingsDialog (`project_settings_dialog.py`)

**Changes:**
- Accepts `user_settings` instead of `project`
- Window title: "Project Settings" → "User Settings"
- Info text updated to show file location
- Loads/saves to user settings manager

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Constructor:
def __init__(self, user_settings=None, parent=None):
    self.user_settings = user_settings
    self.setWindowTitle("User Settings")

# Load:
def _load_settings(self):
    self.author_edit.setText(self.user_settings.author)
    # ...

# Save:
def apply_settings(self):
    self.user_settings.update_settings(settings)
```

### 3. Project Model (`project.py`)

**Changes:**
- **Removed** `self.settings` dictionary
- Projects no longer store settings
- Cleaner, simpler model

**Before:**
```python
self.settings = {
    'author': '',
    'template_directory': '',
    'output_directory': '',
    'theme': 'system'
}
```

**After:**
```python
# Settings removed - now user-specific
```

### 4. ProjectManager (`project_manager.py`)

**Changes:**
- Removed settings save/load from SQLite
- Removed settings from JSON export/import
- No longer manages settings table

**Removed:**
- Save settings to `project_settings` table
- Load settings from `project_settings` table
- Export settings in JSON
- Import settings from JSON

## 📊 **Impact Analysis**

### ✅ Benefits

1. **User Preferences**
   - Theme follows the user, not the project
   - Author name consistent across all projects
   - Directory paths make sense per-user

2. **Simpler Projects**
   - Projects don't contain user preferences
   - Smaller project files
   - Cleaner data model

3. **Better Collaboration**
   - Share projects without exposing personal paths
   - Each team member uses their own settings
   - No conflicts from different preferences

4. **Persistence**
   - Settings survive project deletion
   - One configuration for all work
   - Consistent experience

5. **Privacy**
   - Personal paths not shared in version control
   - Author name not embedded in projects
   - User data stays local

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Existing Projects**
   - Old projects with settings in database still work
   - Settings simply ignored (not loaded)
   - No data loss, just settings not used

2. **JSON Files**
   - Old JSON exports with settings still import
   - Settings field ignored
   - Projects import successfully

3. **Migration**
   - Users need to reconfigure settings once
   - Settings not migrated from projects
   - Clean slate approach

## 🎨 **UI Changes**

### Menu Item
**Before:** Tools → Project Settings...  
**After:** Tools → User Settings...

### Dialog Title
**Before:** "Project Settings"  
**After:** "User Settings"

### Info Text
**Before:**
```
ℹ️ These settings are saved with your project and 
   can be exported/imported via JSON.
```

**After:**

## 💡 **Usage Examples**

### Example 1: First Time User

```
1. Install K2 Designer
2. Launch application
3. Tools → User Settings
4. Configure:
   - Author: "John Doe"
   - Theme: Dark Mode
   - Directories: Set paths
5. Click OK
6. Settings saved to ~/.k2designer/settings.json
7. Create/open any project
8. Settings apply automatically
```

### Example 2: Multiple Projects

```
User has projects: ClientA.k2p, ClientB.k2p, Personal.k2p

All projects use:
- Same author name
- Same theme preference
- Same template directory
- Same output directory

No need to configure per-project!
```

### Example 3: Team Collaboration

```
Developer A:
- Preferences: Dark theme, ~/templates, ~/output
- Shares project.k2p (no personal settings)

Developer B:
- Receives project.k2p
- Opens with own preferences: Light theme, C:\templates, C:\output
- Works with their own settings
- No conflicts!
```

## 🔄 **Migration Guide**

### For Existing Users

If you had settings in projects before:

1. **First Launch**
   - Default settings applied (empty values, system theme)
   
2. **Configure Once**
   - Tools → User Settings
   - Set your preferences
   - Apply to all future work

3. **Old Projects**
   - Open normally
   - Old settings ignored
   - Your user settings apply

### Settings File Location

**To find your settings:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux:
cat ~/.k2designer/settings.json

# Windows:
type %USERPROFILE%\.k2designer\settings.json
```

**To reset settings:**
```bash
# Delete the file:
rm ~/.k2designer/settings.json

# Or edit manually with text editor
```

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### 1. Configure Once
Set up your user settings when you first install K2 Designer.

### 2. Use Absolute Paths
Use full paths for directories to avoid confusion.

### 3. Backup Settings
Optional: backup `~/.k2designer/settings.json` to cloud storage.

### 4. Team Standards
Teams can share template directories but keep individual themes.

### 5. Version Control
Don't commit `.k2designer/` to Git - it's personal.

## 🚀 **Technical Details**

### Settings Manager Architecture

```
UserSettingsManager
├── __init__()
│   ├── Create settings dir
│   ├── Load settings
│   └── Set defaults
│
├── Properties (auto-save)
│   ├── author
│   ├── template_directory
│   ├── output_directory
│   └── theme
│
└── Methods
    ├── load_settings()

    ├── set_setting(key, value)
    ├── get_all_settings()
    └── update_settings(dict)
```

### Data Flow

```
User opens Settings Dialog
    ↓
Dialog loads from UserSettingsManager
    ↓
User modifies settings
    ↓
Dialog saves to UserSettingsManager
    ↓
Manager writes to ~/.k2designer/settings.json
    ↓
Theme applied immediately
    ↓
All projects use new settings
```

## ✅ **Summary**

### What You Get

✅ **Personal settings** - Saved per-user, not per-project  
✅ **Automatic persistence** - Settings remembered forever  
✅ **Simple management** - One configuration for all projects  
✅ **Better privacy** - Personal paths not in shared projects  
✅ **Team friendly** - Each member uses own preferences  
✅ **No migration needed** - Works with existing projects  

### Key Points

1. Settings now in: `~/.k2designer/settings.json`
2. Menu: Tools → User Settings
3. Applies to all projects
4. Theme, author, directories are per-user
5. Old projects still work (settings ignored)

**Status: ✅ Production Ready**

This is a much better architecture that aligns with how users actually want to work!
